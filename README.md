## Overview
GFG-daily-challenge is a repository dedicated to solving daily programming challenges from GeeksforGeeks. Each challenge provides an opportunity to enhance problem-solving skills, practice coding in different languages, and learn new algorithms and data structures.

## Structure
1. **Challenges**: This directory contains subdirectories for each day's challenge. Inside each challenge directory, you'll find:
   - A markdown file (`README.md`) describing the challenge.
   - Solution files named according to the programming language used (e.g., `solution.py`, `solution.java`, `solution.cpp`).
   - Additional resources or notes related to the challenge.

2. **Solutions**: This directory contains solutions organized by programming language. Each subdirectory contains solutions for various challenges written in that language.

3. **Contributing**: If you'd like to contribute, please follow these guidelines:
   - Fork the repository.
   - Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
   - Ensure your code follows the repository's style guide.
   - Submit a pull request with a descriptive title and details of your changes.

### Usage
To participate in the daily challenges:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the current day's challenge directory.
3. Read the challenge description in the `README.md` file.
4. Choose a programming language you're comfortable with.
5. Write your solution in a new file or edit the existing solution file.
6. Test your solution with sample inputs.
